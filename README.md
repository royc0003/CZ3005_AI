- Sympathetic Doctor + GUI
- Purpose:
  - To create a Knowledge-Based System (KBS) using first-order logic.
  - To create an empathetic diagnostic chatbot to help patients with early diagnosis.
- Outcome:
  - Developed an advanced Prolog script emulating a compassionate doctor for diagnostic purposes, capable of engaging in binary-response (yes/no) conversations with patients.
  - This script is uniquely designed to adjust questioning tactics based on the patientâ€™s pain intensity and emotional state, incorporating over five distinct mood metrics (e.g., calm, angry).
  - It includes a sophisticated algorithm to diagnose over five different diseases, each identified by a unique set of five or more symptoms, ensuring sensitive and accurate patient assessment.
  - Integrated with Google's text-to-speech AI.
