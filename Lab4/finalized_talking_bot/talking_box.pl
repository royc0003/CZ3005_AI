%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% Heuristics
% Heuristic to add weights to symptoms. This is done to further differentiate diseases with conflicting symptoms.
%  For instance, both acne and cancer have the same symptom "lump". Which also mean that the symptom "lump" is not unique enough to identify a unique disease.
% This also means that there's a chance that the counter for count_acne = X might also have the same value as the counter for count_cancer.
% To resolve this, heavier weights are added to symptoms that tend to have a stronger indicator towards a particular disease.
% (1) For non-unique symptoms, the increment weight is 1.
% (2) For diseases with total unique symptoms > 2, the increment weight is 2.
% (3) For diseases with total unique symptoms <=2, the increment weight is 3.
% E.g. The unique / stronger indicator for cancer will be "bleed" and "pale_skin" since both symptoms do not overlap with antoher disease
% And since the total unique symptoms are <=2, the increment_cancer weight for bleed and pale_skin will be 3 respectively.
